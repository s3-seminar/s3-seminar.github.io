        "title": "Structured Sparsity Regularization for online MR Image Reconstruction in Accelerated T2* Imaging",
        "excerpt": "\n\n\nPhilippe Ciuciu (CEA/NeuroSpin &amp; Inria Saclay Île-de-France Parietal)\n\nAbstract\nReducing acquisition time is a major challenge in high-resolution MRI that has been successfully addressed by Compressed Sensing (CS) theory. While the scan time has been massively accelerated, the complexity of image recovery algorithms has strongly increased, resulting in slower reconstruction processes. In this work we propose an online approach to shorten image reconstruction times in the CS setting. We leverage the segmented acquisition of anatomical MR data in multiple shots to interleave the MR acquisition and image reconstruction steps. This approach is particularly appealing for 2D high-resolution T2* -weighted anatomical imaging. During the scan, acquired shots are stacked together to form mini-batches and image reconstruction may start from incomplete data. We demonstrate the interest and time savings of this online image reconstruction framework for Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling strategies combined with a single receiver coil. Next, we further extend this formalism to address the more challenging case of multi-receiver phased array acquisition. In this setting, calibrationless image reconstruction leverages structured sparsity regularization to remain compatible with the timing constraints of online image delivery. Our results on ex-vivo 2D T2* -weighted brain images show that high-quality MR images are recovered by the end of acquisition in both acquisition setups.\n\nBiography\nDr. Philippe Ciuciu obtained his PhD in electrical engineering\nfrom the University of Paris-Sud in 2000 and his Habilitation degree in 2008.\nDr. Ciuciu is now CEA Research Director at NeuroSpin where he has led, since\n2018, the Compressed Sensing group in the Inria-CEA Parietal team at NeuroSpin.\nDr. Ciuciu’s work has led to more than 200 research outputs including more than\n50 peer-reviewed articles in international journals such as SIAM Imaging\nSciences, IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging,\nMedical Image Analysis, NeuroImage, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, etc. He also\nholds 2 MRI-related patents. His current research interests are in developing\naccelerated acquisition and image reconstruction techniques, including deep\nlearning techniques, for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with applications in\nclinical and cognitive neuroscience at 3 and 7 Tesla. As IEEE Senior Member, he\nhas represented the IEEE Signal Processing Society in the International\nSymposium on Biomedical Imaging for the 2019-2020 period. He has also been\nappointed to take part to the steering committee of the 2021 ESMRMB conference\nin Barcelona. Since 2019 he holds a position as Senior Area Editor for the IEEE\nopen Journal of Signal Processing and that of Vice Chair for the Biomedical\nImage and Signal Analytics (BISA) technical committee of the EURASIP society. In\n2020, he has been appointed as Associate Editor to Frontiers in Neuroscience,\nsection Brain imaging methods.\n\nReferences\n\n1) El Gueddari L, Ciuciu P, Chouzenoux E, Vignaud A, Pesquet JC.
