###### Abstract

Over 4000 exoplanets have been detected so far. They have deeply transformed our
understanding of planetary system formation, and expanded our possibilities to
search for life outside of Earth. The smaller and the more distant to their host
stars exoplanets are, the harder they are to detect. Earth «&nbsp;twins&nbsp;»
orbiting solar-type stars are still out of reach because of very complex
astrophysical and instrumental noises. To overcome this difficulty, we need new
methods to analyse unevenly sampled, multi-variate time series: better models,
computational methods and decision rules to claim detections. In this talk I
will mostly focus on the latter aspect. Exoplanet detections are claimed based
on the value of a statistical significance metric: if it is greater than a
certain threshold, a detection is claimed. I will address the question of the
optimal significance metric in the general setting of detection of parametric
signals, and advocate for a Bayesian hypothesis testing framework where
hypotheses are indexed by continuous variables.

###### Biography

Nathan Hara is a research fellow at the university of Geneva since 2017, which
he joined after a PhD with Jacques Laskar and Gwenaël Boué at Paris Observatory.
He works on statistical techniques to detect exoplanets, in particular Earth
twins, which are prime candidates for the detection of life outside of Earth,
and observational programs to unveil multi-planetary systems.
