###### Abstract
Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used signal
processing technique in extracting unobserved independent source
signals from their observed multivariate mixture recordings. The
FastICA fixed-point algorithm is one of the most popular ICA
algorithms. In this talk, we develop low-complexity and stable
bootstrap procedures for FastICA estimators. Such methods enable
reliable bootstrap-based statistical inference in large-scale real-
world ICA problems. For example testing statistical significance of
mixing coefficients in the ICA model can be used to identify the
contribution of a specific source signal-of-interest onto the observed
mixture variables. An application of the proposed bootstrapping
technique in Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing is
presented. We also provide an alternative derivation of FastICA. The
algorithm has been originally derived and motivated as being an
approximate Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm. In this talk an alternative
derivation of the FastICA algorithm is presented that illustrates how
the fixed-point FastICA algorithm is coupled with the exact NR
algorithm. Furthermore, the new derivation does not require
assumptions and approximations that were used in the original
derivation.
