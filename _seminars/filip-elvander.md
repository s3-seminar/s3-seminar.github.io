###### Abstract
In this talk, I will present recent developments on our work on optimal transport for linear inverse problems.
Optimal transport (OT) offers a powerful framework for measuring distances between distributions of mass,
displaying remarkable robustness to perturbations and with attractive ability to induce interpolants.
Although theory and algorithms for OT have predominantly been designed for the direct case, i.e.,
when one has access to the distributions themselves, there has been recent work on extending the OT ideas also to inverse problems.
This opens up for opportunities in leveraging OT in signal processing applications.
In particular, we will in this talk see how OT can be applied to problems of broad-band spatio-temporal spectral problems and system identification.
