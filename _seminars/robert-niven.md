###### Abstract
A branch of Bayesian inference involves the analysis of so-called
"Bayesian networks", defined as directed acyclic networks composed of
probabilistic connections [e.g. 1-2]. We extend this class of networks
to consider cyclic Bayesian networks, which incorporate every pair of
inverse conditional probabilities or probability density functions,
thereby enabling the application of Bayesian updating around the
network. The networks are assumed Markovian, although this assumption
can be relaxed when necessary. The analysis of probabilistic cycles
reveals a deep connection to the mutual information between pairs of
variables on the network. Analysis of a four-parameter network - of
the form of a commutative diagram - is shown to enable thedevelopment
of a new branch of Bayesian inference using a reduced order model
(coarse-graining) framework.
