###### Abstract
One of the differences between memory function of hypocampus and
neural networks situated at neocortex is that in the latter memory
operation still reflect the topography informing synaptic connections.
This means that the activity of a unit relates also to its position in
the tissue. We introduce two approaches for incorporating the
information of the geometry of the underlying neural network into its
dynamics. This phenomenon is carried out based on two probability
rules for selecting storing patterns. First a Gibbs type distribution
inspired by the architecture of the network is applied. We are then
led to a second method to introduce topological effects on the
dynamics of the network. In both approaches a significant enhancement
on the capacity of the network is observed after considerable rigorous
computations.

###### Biography
I obtained my DEA in 2001 and my PhD in 2004 at University Paris 7
under the supervision of Professor Daniel Bennequin. The title of my
thesis was Super-symmetry and Complex Geometry. I joined the
department of mathematical sciences of Sharif university of technology
as an assistant professor in 2004 and in 2012 I became an associate
professor at the same department.
