###### Abstract
The NRL multi-aperture SAR: system description and recent results The
Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) multi-aperture synthetic aperture
radar (MSAR) is an airborne test bed designed to investigate remote
sensing and surveillance applications that exploit multiple along-
track phase centers, in particular, applications that require
measurement of scene motion. The system operates at X-band and
supports 32 along-track phase centers through the use of two transmit
horns and 16 receive antennas. As illustrated in this presentation,
SAR images generated with these phase centers can be coherently
combined to directly measure scene motion using the Velocity SAR
(VSAR) algorithm. In September 2014, this unique radar was deployed
for the first time on an airborne platform, a Saab 340 aircraft. This
presentation presents a description of the system, initial images from
the September 2014 tests, and the results of initial coherent analyses
to produce estimates of scene and target motion. These images were
collected over an ocean inlet and contain a variety of moving
backscatter sources, including automobiles, ships, shoaling ocean
waves, and tidal currents.

###### Biography
Luke Rosenberg received his Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering in 1999, Masters in Signal and Information Processing in
2001 and PhD in 2006 all from the University of Adelaide in Australia.
In 2000 he joined the Defence Science and Technology Organisation as
an RF engineer, then worked as a research scientist in the imaging
radar systems group and recently in the maritime radar group. He is
also an adjunct senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide and is
currently on attachment at the US Naval Research Laboratory working on
algorithms for focussing moving scatterers in synthetic aperture radar
imagery. His interests are in the areas of radar signal processing and
the modelling and simulation of radar backscatter. In particular, his
work has covered radar image formation, adaptive filtering, detection
theory, and radar and clutter modelling. He is an active member of the
SET-185 NATO panel on high grazing angle sea-clutter and has published
over 50 conference, journal and technical reports.
