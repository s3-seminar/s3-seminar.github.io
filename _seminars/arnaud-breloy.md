###### Abstract
Covariance Matrix (CM) estimation is an ubiquitous problem in
statistical signal processing. In terms of application purposes, the
accuracy of the CM estimate directly impacts the performance of the
considered adaptive process. In the context of modern data-sets, two
major problems are currently at stake: - Samples are often drawn from
heterogeneous (non gaussian) distributions. - Only a low sample
support is available. To respond to these problems, one has to develop
new estimation tools that are based on an appropriate modeling of the
data. Regarding to the first issue, the Complex Elliptically Symetric
distributions framework have attracted lately lots of attention since
it can account for the noise heterogeneity, thus lead to robusts
estimators. As for the second the second issue, the true CM is often
known to possess an inherent structure in many applications. This
prior knowledge can be exploited to reduce the numbre of required
samples in the estimation process. To enjoy best of both worlds,
research currently focuses on ways to develop robust CM estimators
with a constrained structure. In this talk, we will present a specific
model, driven by radar applications (also more widely extendible),
where the samples are drawn from a low rank low rank heterogeneous
distribution (the so-called clutter) plus a white gaussian noise
(thermal noise). We will present newly developed robust estimation
methods of the CM parameters adapted to this context. The use of these
new estimators will be illustrated in a Space time Adaptive Processing
for airborne radar application.
