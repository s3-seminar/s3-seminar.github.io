###### Abstract
Correlation mining arises in many areas of engineering, social
sciences, and natural sciences. Correlation mining discovers columns
of a random matrix that are highly correlated with other columns of
the matrix and can be used to construct a dependency network over
columns. However, when the number n of samples is finite and the
number p of columns increases such exploration becomes futile due to a
phase transition phenomenon: spurious discoveries will eventually
dominate. In this presentation I will present theory for predicting
these phase transitions and present Poisson limit theorems that can be
used to determine finite sample behavior of correlation structure. The
theory has application to areas including gene expression analysis,
network security, remote sensing, and portfolio selection.

###### Biography
Alfred O. Hero III received the B.S. (summa cum laude) from Boston
University (1980) and the Ph.D from Princeton University (1984), both
in Electrical Engineering. Since 1984 he has been with the University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he is the R. Jamison and Betty Williams
Professor of Engineering. His primary appointment is in the Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and he also has
appointments, by courtesy, in the Department of Biomedical Engineering
and the Department of Statistics. From 2008-2013 he was held the
Digiteo Chaire d'Excellence at the Ecole Superieure d'Electricite,
Gif-sur-Yvette, France. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and several of his research articles
have recieved best paper awards. Alfred Hero was awarded the
University of Michigan Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award (2011).
He received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Meritorious Service
Award (1998), the IEEE Third Millenium Medal (2000), and the IEEE
Signal Processing Society Technical Achievement Award (2014). Alfred
Hero was President of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (2006-2008)
and was on the Board of Directors of the IEEE (2009-2011) where he
served as Director of Division IX (Signals and Applications). Alfred
Hero's recent research interests are in statistical signal processing,
machine learning and the analysis of high dimensional spatio-temporal
data. Of particular interest are applications to networks, including
social networks, multi-modal sensing and tracking, database indexing
and retrieval, imaging, and genomic signal processing.
