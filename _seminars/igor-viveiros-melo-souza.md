###### Abstract
Cointegrated and non-cointegrated processes from economic and
econometric point of view, based on the time and frequency domain will
be presented. Standard tests for cointegrated times series will be
discussed as well as their advantages and drawbacks in financial area.
In addition to the standard methods, recent methodologies based on the
frequency domain will be introduced. The methods will be discussed for
multivariate time series with short and long memory properties. Some
robust tests will also be presented. The concepts and definitions will
be motivated by some real financial time series.

###### Biography
I am Graduated in Economic Sciences at the Federal University of Minas
Gerais (2002), Brazil, Master's degree in Economics at the University
of São Paulo (2006), Brazil, and PhD in Statistics at Federal
University of Minas Gerais (2014). I am a full Professor at the
Department of Economics of the Federal University of Minas Gerais,
where I teach for undergraduate and PhD programs. I work in time
series analysis with a special interest in long-memory, robustness,
unit root, regression time series, bootstrap and analysis of
cointegrated systems. My main areas of applications are financial
econometrics, macroeconomics. Also I have been worked in some applied
microeconomics issues such as crime dynamics for the Belo Horizonte
city.
