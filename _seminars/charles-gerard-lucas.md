###### Abstract
The empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is a data-driven time-scale representation based on adaptive filters.
Its robustness and flexibility have led to significant developments and a growing number of applications over the past decade.
However, most studies have focused on theoretical aspects for one-dimensional signals, and extensions to images have been limited to a specific generating function.
This presentation introduces a general framework for the multidimensional empirical wavelet transform that can be derived from any generating function.
In addition, a numerical implementation is presented and illustrated with examples.

###### Bio
My research lies in the field of signal and image processing, with a particular focus on the development of wavelet theory and variational methods.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon in 2023, after which I held a postdoctoral position at San Diego State University (California).
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Grenoble,
where my work focuses on the reconstruction of circumstellar disks through the integration of variational approaches and neural network techniques.
