###### Abstract
This talk explores integrating data assimilation (DA) and machine learning techniques to predict and reconstruct multi-variable high-dimensional environmental fields,
such as air quality and geophysical data, from sparse and movable sensor observations.
Traditional DA methods, while effective, face challenges like computational cost and error covariance estimation.
AI-driven latent data assimilation addresses these by compressing high-dimensional data into a latent space using autoencoders,
enabling efficient corrections thanks to the auto-differentiation of neural networks.
Supervised learning with advanced CNNs or masked autoencoder complements this by directly reconstructing fields from sparse, unstructured data.
Applications include correcting NO₂ levels in Ile de France using sparse sensor networks and experiments on the multi-variate weatherbench dataset with randomly placed observation points.
