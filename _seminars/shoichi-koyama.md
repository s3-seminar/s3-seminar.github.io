###### Abstract
Physical reproduction of a sound field enables us to construct more
realistic audio systems. Since large scale audio systems are becoming
more feasible thanks to the recent development of acoustic sensors and
transducers, this kind of technologies have attracted attention in
recent years. In sound field recording and reproduction, a way to
convert signals received by microphones into driving signals of
loudspeakers is important. I introduce a method using wave field
reconstruction (WFR) filter and its application to a real-time sound
field transmission system. Since a quality of the reproduced sound
field depends on intervals between array elements in current methods,
a lot of microphones and loudspeakers are required to achieve highly
accurate reproduction. Recent advances indicated that sparse sound
field representation enables higher reproduction accuracy above the
spatial Nyquist frequency when there are fewer microphones than
loudspeakers, i.e., super-resolution in sound field recording and
reproduction.
