###### Abstract
A prerequisite for any statistical inference method is the notion of statistical
model, i.e. a collection of probability density functions (pdfs) that is able to
characterize random phenomena based on their observations. The most widely used
models in signal processing applications are the parametric ones. However,
parametric models are generally too “narrow” and not able to take into account
the lack of a-priori information that affects inference problems in practice.

In this talk, we introduce the more general semiparametric characterization of
the collected data. A semiparametric model is a set of pdfs characterized by a
finite-dimensional parameter vector of interest along with an
infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, i.e. a function. We show how to obtain
the Semiparametric Cramér-Rao

Bound (SCRB) for the estimation of the finite-dimensional parameter vector in
the presence of nuisance functions. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility
to derive estimators of the finite-dimensional parameter vector able to
reconcile two dichotomic concepts: robustness and (semiparametric) efficiency.

Throughout the talk, as common thread and example to clarify the theoretical
findings, inference problems in Elliptically Symmetric (ES) distributed data
will be analysed. Particular attention will be devoted to the well-known
covariance/scatter matrix estimation problem in the presence of an unknown
density generator.

###### Biography
Stefano Fortunati graduated in telecommunication engineering and received the
PhD at the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2008 and 2012 respectively. In 2012, he
joined the Department of “Ingegneria dell’Informazione” of the University of
Pisa, where he worked as researcher with a post-doc position until Sept. 2019.
Since Oct. 2019, he is a post-doc researcher at the Laboratoire des Signaux et
Systèmes (L2S) CentraleSupélec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. From Sept. 2012 to Nov.
2012 and from Sept. 2013 to Nov. 2013, he was a visiting researcher at the CMRE
NATO Research Center in La Spezia, Italy. From May 2017 to April 2018, he spent
a period of one year as visiting researcher with the Signal Processing Group, at
the Technische Universität Darmstadt. He is in the organizing committee of the
2020 IEEE Radar Conference to be held in Florence in September 2020. He was in
the organizing committee of the 2nd Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing
(CIP2010), of the 2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and
Signal Processing (ICASSP2014) and he was the Publication Chair of the 3rd
International Workshop on Compressed Sensing Theory and its Applications to
Radar, Sonar and Remote Sensing (CoSeRa 2015). Dr. Fortunati’s professional
expertise encompasses different areas of the statistical signal processing:
estimation and detection theory, misspecification and semiparametric theory,
robust statistics and performance bounds.
