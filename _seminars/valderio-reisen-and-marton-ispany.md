###### Abstract
The hybrid GAM-PCA-VAR model, which is the combination of the
principal component analysis (PCA) and the generalized additive model
(GAM) along with a vector autoregressive (VAR) process, is proposed
for studying the health effects of air pollution. The model is applied
to a real data set with the aim of quantifying the association between
the number of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases as response
variable and air pollution concentrations, especially, PM10, SO2, NO2,
CO and O3, as covariates.
