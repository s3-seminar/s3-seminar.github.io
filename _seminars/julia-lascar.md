###### Abstract
In astrophysics, X-ray telescopes can collect cubes of data 
called hyperspectral images. These data cubes have two spatial 
dimensions, and one spectral dimension. The subject of my thesis is to 
implement algorithms to analyze X-ray hyperspectral images of supernovae 
remnants. In particular, I have implemented a non-stationary unmixing 
algorithm (unmixing where each endmember varies spectrally), and a 
fusion algorithm to obtain the best resolutions from two generation of 
telescopes. The aim of my thesis is to combine the two, and thus obtain 
an algorithm that unmixes and fuses hyperspectral data simultaneously.

###### Bio
Julia Lascar is a 2nd year PhD student working at the CEA with 
Jérôme Bobin and Fabio Acero. Her research focuses on implementing 
signal processing algorithms applied to hyperspectral X-ray 
astrophysics, with a particular interest in supernova remnants. She has 
a Master's degree in astrophysics from McGill University, Montreal, and 
a M2 in statistics from ENSAI, Rennes. Before that, she studied Physics 
and Philosophy at King's College London.
