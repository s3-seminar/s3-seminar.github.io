###### Abstract
Clément Walter, 25, graduated from Mines ParisTech in 2013. Beforehand
he attended preparatory classes in Lycée Sainte-Geneviève (branch
Maths and Physics). For his master degree he specialised in
Geostatistics and started working with CEA as an intern on emulation
of complex computer codes (especially kriging) for rare event
simulation and estimation. He has then pursued his work in a PhD under
the direction of Pr. Josselin Garnier, focusing on multilevel
splitting methods.
