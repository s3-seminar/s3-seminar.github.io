###### Abstract
Stochastic approximation techniques have been used in various contexts
in machine learning and adaptive filtering. We investigate the
asymptotic behavior of a stochastic version of the forward-backward
splitting algorithm for finding a zero of the sum of a maximally
monotone set-valued operator and a cocoercive operator in a Hilbert
space. In our general setting, stochastic approximations of the
cocoercive operator and perturbations in the evaluation of the
resolvents of the set-valued operator are possible. In addition,
relaxations and not necessarily vanishing proximal parameters are
allowed. Weak almost sure convergence properties of the iterates are
established under mild conditions on the underlying stochastic
processes. Leveraging on these results, we propose a stochastic
version of a popular primal-dual proximal optimization algorithm, and
establish its convergence. We finally show the interest of these
results in an online image restoration problem.
