###### Abstract
Recently, there has been considerable interest in integer-valued time
series models. Motivation to include discrete data models comes from
the need to account for the discrete nature of certain data sets,
often counts of events, objects or individuals. Among the most
successful integer-valued time series models proposed in the
literature we mention the INteger-valued AutoRegressive model of order
p (INAR(p)). However, seasonal count processes have not been
investigated yet, except one of our new papers. In the talk, we study
INAR processes which possess serial and seasonal structure as well.
The main properties of the models will be derived such as the
stationarity and the autocorrelation function. The conditional least
squares and conditional maximum likelihood estimators of the model
parameters will be studied and their asymptotical properties will be
established. In addition, we would like to discuss the case in which
the marginal distributions are Poisson in detail. Monte Carlo
experiments will be conducted to evaluate and compare the performance
of various estimators for finite sample sizes. Real data set on the
area of insurance will be applied to evaluate the model performance.

###### Biography
Márton Ispány received the M.Sc.(1989) and PhD (summa cum laude) in
Statistics (1997) from University of Debrecen. Since 2007 he has been
with the Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Informatics,
University of Debrecen. Since 2012 he has been the head of the
department. Márton Ispány 's recent research interests are in
branching processes (functional limit theorems, asymptotics for
conditional least squares estimation, integer valued autoregression),
statistical modelling(generalized SVD, contaminated statistical
models, EM algorithm), data mining (decision trees, stochastic
algorithms, MCMC, web mining), and applied statistics: econometrics
and insurance, cross-country modelling, statistical genetics.
