###### Abstract
Condition monitoring of machines is an essential part of smooth,
efficient, safe, and productive operation of machines. In this
presentation, focus will be on rotating machines and in the use of
vibration signals. Classification of vibration signals to different
states of machines has been achieved through the developments and
applications of signal processing and machine learning. This
presentation will cover research efforts and some case studies carried
out over many years.

###### Biography
Professor Asoke K. Nandi received the degree of Ph.D. in Physics from
the University of Cambridge, Cambridge (UK). He held academic
positions in several universities, including Oxford (UK), Imperial
College London (UK), Strathclyde (UK), and Liverpool (UK) as well as
Finland Distinguished Professorship in Jyvaskyla (Finland). In 2013 he
moved to Brunel University London (UK), to become the Chair and Head
of Electronic and Computer Engineering. Professor Nandi is a
Distinguished Visiting Professor at Tongji University (China) and an
Adjunct Professor at University of Calgary (Canada). In 1983 Professor
Nandi contributed to the discovery of the three fundamental particles
known as W+, W− and Z0 (by the UA1 team at CERN), providing the
evidence for the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces,
which was recognized by the Nobel Committee for Physics in 1984. His
current research interests lie in the areas of signal processing and
machine learning, with applications to communications, gene expression
data, functional magnetic resonance data, and biomedical data. He has
made many fundamental theoretical and algorithmic contributions to
many aspects of signal processing and machine learning. He has much
expertise in “Big Data”, dealing with heterogeneous data, and
extracting information from multiple datasets obtained in different
laboratories and different times. He has authored over 500 technical
publications, including 200 journal papers as well as four books,
entitled Automatic Modulation Classification: Principles, Algorithms
and Applications (Wiley, 2015), Integrative Cluster Analysis in
Bioinformatics (Wiley, 2015), Automatic Modulation Recognition of
Communications Signals (Springer, 1996), and Blind Estimation Using
Higher-Order Statistics (Springer, 1999),. Recently he published in
Blood, BMC Bioinformatics, IEEE TWC, NeuroImage, PLOS ONE, Royal
Society Interface, and Signal Processing. The h-index of his
publications is 63 (Google Scholar). Professor Nandi is a Fellow of
the Royal Academy of Engineering and also a Fellow of seven other
institutions including the IEEE and the IET. Among the many awards he
received are the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(USA) Heinrich Hertz Award in 2012, the Glory of Bengal Award for his
outstanding achievements in scientific research in 2010, the Water
Arbitration Prize of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (UK) in
1999, and the Mountbatten Premium, Division Award of the Electronics
and Communications Division, of the Institution of Electrical
Engineers (UK) in 1998.
