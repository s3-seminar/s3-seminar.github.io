###### Abstract
The role of Internet and Communication Technology (ICT) in bringing about a
revolution in almost all aspects of human life needs no introduction. It is
indeed a well-known fact that the transmission of the information at a rapidpace
has transformed all spheres of human life such as economy, education, and health
to name a few. In this context, and as the standardization of the fifth
generation (5G) of wireless communication systems (WCSs) has been completed, and
5G networks are in their early stage of deployment, the research visioning and
planning of the sixth generation (6G) of WCSs are being initiated. 6G is
expected to be the next focus in wireless communication and networking and aim
to provide new superior communication services to meet the future
hyper-connectivity demands in the 2030s. In addition, keeping in mind that
urbanized populations have been the major beneficiary of the advances offered by
the previous generations of WCSs and motivated by the recently adopted united
nations sustainability development goals intended to be achieved by the year
2030, 6G networks are anticipated to democratize the benefits of ICT. Indeed
these advantages are still not experienced by almost 4 billion people in the
world who are still “unconnected or under-connected” and who suffer as such from
the “digital divide”, a term coined in order to emphasize the lack of ICT
infrastructure in many parts of the world. Given this background, this talk aims
to (i) provide an envisioned picture of 6G, (ii) serve as a research guideline
in the beyond 5G era, and (iii) go over the recently proposed solutions to
provide high-speed connectivity in under-covered areas to serve and contribute
to the development of far-flung regions.
