###### Abstract
The study of vascular networks is important in medical imaging because
disease affecting blood vessels is the first cause of mortality and
morbidity in the Western world. Yet, surprisingly, theses studies have
not been the subject of major research efforts. From the low-level
vision point of view, the vast majority of image processing techniques
assume objects that are locally isotropic, whereas blood vessels are
always thin and oriented at every scale. They are also inherently 3D
and cannot usually be studied correctly in projections. With respect
to scale, most blood vessels are too thin to be imaged irrespective of
the imaging modality. Yet various blood vessel diseases, affecting
blood perfusion for example, occur in vessels that cannot be imaged in
MRI or scanner. In this talk, I will outline research performed in the
last few years in this area. I will present some efficient low-level
vision filters designed for thin and elongated objects. I will also
show some recent work using a generative model (not based on deep
learning) to produce realistic patient-specific vessel models that can
be used to produce a forward imaging model for perfusion. This model
can be used to solve related inverse problems, such as finding the
cause of a perfusion deficit from observed perfusion.

###### Biography
Hugues Talbot received the engineering degree from Ecole Centrale de
Paris (now CentraleSupelec) in 1989; the DEA (Master’s degree) from
Université Paris VI (now Université Pierre et Marie Curie) in 1990;
the PhD from Ecole des Mines de Paris (now Mines Paristech) and MIT in
1993 and the Habilitation from Université Paris Est (soon to be called
Université Gustave Eiffel) on Friday the 13th 2013. Put off by the
state of flux of French higher education, he left for Australia in
1994 and in due time became a principal research scientist at CSIRO,
in mathematics and statistics department. Slowly realizing that things
were actually not much better there, he came back in 2004 to take a
professorship position at ESIEE Paris. He eventually became Dean for
Research there, before joining CentraleSupelec as a professor in 2018,
in the computer vision department (CVN). His interests include but are
not limited to computer vision, medical imaging, image restoration,
optimisation, machine learning, mathematical morphology and discrete
geometry.
