###### Abstract

Due to the large availability of raw data, the appeal for data fusion has been
steadily growing in the signal processing community. Hence the design of coupled
models, that exploit shared information between several observations. It is thus
expected from data fusion that it provides a better estimation of the parameters
of interest rather than separate processing of the datasets.

In remote sensing, hyperspectral images have been thoroughly exploited in, e.g.,
spectral unmixing, image classification or target detection. The natural
3-dimensional format of these images allows them to be mathematically
represented as 3-dimensional tensors.

In this presentation, I will introduce some of my recent results regarding
multimodal data fusion using low-rank tensor decompositions, applied on
hyperspectral images. I will focus on the hyperspectral super-resolution and
spectral unmixing problems accounting for inter-image variability. While the
first one addresses image reconstruction, the second one falls under the scope
of source separation. A major difficulty lies in the presence of inter-image
variability, that reinforces the ill-posedness of the problems. I will introduce
two algorithms to solve the problems at hand. Then, I will showcase their
performance for image fusion and spectral unmixing on a set of real
hyperspectral data accounting for spectral variability.
