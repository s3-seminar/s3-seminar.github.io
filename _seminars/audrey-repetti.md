###### Abstract
Recent developments in imaging and data analysis techniques came along
with an increasing need for fast convex optimization methods for
solving large scale problems. A simple optimization strategy to
minimize the sum of a Lipschitz differentiable function and a non
smooth function is the forward-backward algorithm. In this
presentation, several approaches to accelerate convergence speed and
to reduce complexity of this algorithm will be proposed. More
precisely, in a first part, preconditioning methods adapted to non
convex minimization problems will be presented, and in a second part,
stochastic optimization techniques will be described in the context of
convex optimization. The different proposed methods will be used to
solve several inverse problems in signal and image processing.
