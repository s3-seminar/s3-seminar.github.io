###### Abstract
We consider the problem of transmitting a common message from a
transmitter to two receivers over a broadcast channel, which is also
called multicast channel in this case. The two receivers are allowed
to cooperate with each other in full-duplex over non-orthogonal
channels. We investigate the information-theoretic upper and lower
bounds on the achievable rate of such channels. In particular, we
propose a two-round cooperation scheme in which the receivers
interactively perform compress-forward (CF) and then decode-forward
(DF) to improve the achievable rate. Numerical results comparing the
proposed scheme to existing schemes and the cutset upper bound are
provided. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the non-
interactive DF and CF schemes as well as the noisy network coding. The
gain over the DF scheme becomes larger when the channel becomes
symmetric, while the gain over the CF scheme becomes larger when the
channel becomes asymmetric.

###### Biography
Victor Exposito received the Engineering and M.Sc. degree
(valedictorian) in communication systems and networks from the
Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Rennes (INSA-Rennes),
Rennes, France, in 2014. He is currently working at Mitsubishi
Electric R&D Centre Europe (MERCE-France), Rennes, France and Ecole
Superieure d'Electricite (CentraleSupelec), Gif-sur-Yvette, France,
toward the Ph.D. degree. His current research interests mainly lie in
the area of network information theory.
