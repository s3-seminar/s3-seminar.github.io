###### Abstract
SAR interferometry (InSAR) enables the analysis of topological changes in natural sites or urban areas.
However, the use of denoising algorithms is usually required to extract relevant information from interferograms.
We will first introduce the application and established multi-temporal InSAR denoising algorithms from the literature, that relate to optimization on the torus on phase-only-vectors.
Then we investigate the use of Riemannian flow-matching models for InSAR.
Specifically, we consider two use cases: i) the generation of realistic interferograms for data augmentation, ii) the denoising of interferograms.
Experiments unconditional generation and conditional generation for denoising of interferograms on Sentinel-1 data illustrate the interest of thes approach.
