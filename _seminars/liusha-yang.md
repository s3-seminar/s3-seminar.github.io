###### Abstract
The performance of the global minimum risk portfolio (GMVP) relies on
the accuracy of the estimated covariance matrix of the portfolio asset
returns. For large portfolios, the number of available market returns
is often of similar order to the number of assets, making the sample
covariance matrix performs poorly. In this talk, we discuss two newly-
developed GMVP optimization strategies under high dimensional
analysis. The first approach is based on the shrinkage Tylerâ€™s robust
M-estimation with a risk-minimizing shrinkage parameter. It not only
deals with the problem of sample insufficiency, but also the
impulsiveness of financial data. The second approach is built upon a
spiked covariance model, by assuming the population covariance matrix
follows the spiked covariance model, in which several eigenvalues are
significantly larger than all the others, which all equal one. The
performances of our strategies will be demonstrated through synthetic
and real data simulations.
