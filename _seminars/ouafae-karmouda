###### Abstract

Supervised learning is a major task to classify datasets. Inour context, we are interested into classification from high-order tensors datasets. The ”curse of dimensionality” statesthat the complexities in terms of storage and computationgrow exponentially with the order. As a consequence, themethod from the state-of-art based on the Higher-Order SVD(HOSVD) works well but suffers from severe limitation interms of complexities. In this work, we propose a fast Grass-mannian kernel-based method for high-order tensor learningbased on the equivalence between the Tucker and the tensor-train decompositions. Our solution is linked to the tensor net-work, where the aim is to break the initial high-order ten-sor into a collection of low-order tensors (at most 3-order).We show on several real datasets that the proposed methodreaches a similar accuracy classification rate as the Grass-mannian kernel-based method based on the HOSVD but for amuch lower complexity.

###### Biography

Ouafae Karmouda receives a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the Faculty of Science and Technologies of Fes, Morocco in 2018. She receives a Master degree in Data Science from the Aix-Marseille University in 2019. Currently, she is a second year PhD student under the supervision of Rémy Boyer and Jérémie Boulanger in SIGMA team at CRIStAL laboratory, Lille. Her research interests focus on developping/improving Maching learning Algorithms for multidimensional data (tensors). She is particulary interested in kernel methods and Deep Learning techniques for high dimensional data. The challenge when dealing with tensors lies in the « curse of dimensionality ». In other words, the computational complexity grows exponentially with the order of tensors. To mitigate this issue, she is interested in Tensor network models and particularly the Tensor Train decomposition.
