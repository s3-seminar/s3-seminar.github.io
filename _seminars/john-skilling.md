###### Abstract
John Skilling was awarded his PhD in radio astronomy in 1969. Through
the 1970s and 1980s he was a lecturer in applied mathematics at
Cambridge University, specialising in data analysis. He left to
concentrate on consultancy work, originally using maximum entropy
methods but moving to Bayesian methodology when algorithms became
sufficiently powerful. John has been a prominent contributor to the
“MaxEnt” conferences since their beginning in 1981. He is the
discoverer of the nested sampling algorithm which performs integration
over spaces of arbitrary dimension, which is the basic operation
dictated by the sum rule of Bayesian calculus.
