###### Abstract
We introduce two methods of symbolic integration for definite
integrals: the method of brackets, based on the Ramanujanâ€™s master
theorem; and integrating by differentiating method, from the Fourier
transform of Dirac delta function. Besides some basic examples and
latest results of both methods, respectively, a formal connection
between these methods will be presented in the end.
