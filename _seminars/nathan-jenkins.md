###### Abstract
Most tools that scientists use for the preparation of scholarly
manuscripts, such as Microsoft Word and LaTeX, function offline and do
not account for the born-digital nature of research objects. Also,
most authoring tools in use today are not designed for collaboration
and as scientific collaborations grow in size, research transparency
and the attribution of scholarly credit are at stake. In this talk, I
will show how Authorea allows scientists to collaboratively write rich
data-driven manuscripts on the web–articles that would natively offer
readers a dynamic, interactive experience with an article’s full text,
images, data, and code–paving the road to increased data sharing, data
reuse, research reproducibility, and Open Science.

###### Biography
Nathan Jenkins is co-founder and CTO of Authorea. A condensed matter
physicist, Nathan completed his Ph.D. at the University of Geneva
where he studied electronic properties of high temperature
superconductors at the atomic scale. He was then awarded a Swiss
National Science Foundation scholarship to study as a postdoc at NYU
where examined the dynamics of protein folding via atomic force
microscopy. Hailing from California, Nathan resides between Geneva,
Switzerland and New York City.
