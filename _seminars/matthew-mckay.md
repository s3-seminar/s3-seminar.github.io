###### Abstract
Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is one of the leading causes
of liver failure and liver cancer, affecting around 3% of the world's
population. Current treatment for HCV is expensive, frequently fails,
and accompanies massive side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need
for an efficient HCV vaccine. The major problem related to the design
of a HCV vaccine is its extreme variability that helps it to evade
immune surveillance. This talk will discuss a new approach to vaccine
design for HCV based on finding "multi-dimensionally conserved
residues?. Effectively, the approach is based on a statistical study
of the diverse publicly-available HCV sequences, using methods common
in statistical signal processing; primarily, robust covariance
estimation. Our analysis reveals parts of the virus that may be most
susceptible to immune pressure, despite the high mutability of the
virus. These studies are backed up with clinical evidence and serve as
a basis for new vaccine designs that we propose. The talk is directed
towards an electrical engineering or statistical signal processing
audience, and assumes no prior knowledge of biology or immunology.

###### Biography
Matthew McKay received his Ph.D. from the University of Sydney,
Australia, prior to joining the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology (HKUST), where he is currently the Hari Harilela Associate
Professor of Electronic and Computer Engineering. He is currently on
leave at MIT as a Visiting Scientist in the Institute for Medical
Engineering and Science (IMES). Matthew's research interests include
communications, signal processing, and associated applications. Most
recently, he has developed a keen interest in the interdisciplinary
areas of computational immunology and financial engineering. He and
his coauthors have received best paper awards at IEEE ICASSP 2006,
IEEE VTC 2006, ACM IWCMC 2010, IEEE Globecom 2010, and IEEE ICC 2011.
He also received a 2010 Young Author Best Paper Award by the IEEE
Signal Processing Society, the 2011 Stephen O. Rice Prize in the Field
of Communication Theory by the IEEE Communication Society, and the
2011 Young Investigator Research Excellence Award by the School of
Engineering at HKUST. In 2013, he was the recipient the Asia-Pacific
Best Young Researcher Award by the IEEE Communication Society.
