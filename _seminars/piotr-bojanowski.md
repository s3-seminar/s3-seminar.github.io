###### Abstract
In this talk, I will describe FastText, an open-source library that
can be used to train word representations or text classifiers. This
library is based on our generalization of the famous word2vec model,
allowing to adapt it easily to various applications. I will go over
the formulation of the skipgram and cbow models of word2vec and how
these were extended to meet the needs of our model. I will describe in
details the two applications of our model, namely document
classification and building morphologically-rich word representations.
In both applications, our model achieves very competitive performance
while being very simple and fast.
