###### Abstract
In this talk I will discuss results on the singular values of products of many random matrices (joint with Andrew Ahn),
and interesting analogues of these results for products of integer and p-adic random matrices.

###### Biography
Roger defended his PhD at MIT in 2023, advised by Alexei Borodin, and is now a postdoc at KTH.
He is interested in various topics in probability, mathematical physics and related areas.
