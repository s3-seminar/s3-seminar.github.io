###### Abstract
In this talk, I will present a new optimization algorithm for sparse
logistic regression based on a stochastic version of the Douglas-
Rachford splitting method. The algorithm sweeps the training set by
randomly selecting a mini-batch of data at each iteration, and it
allows us to update the variables in a block coordinate manner. Our
approach leverages the proximity operator of the logistic loss, which
is expressed with the generalized Lambert W function. Experiments
carried out on standard datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our
approach w.r.t. stochastic gradient-like methods. (joint work with
