###### Abstract

Determinantal point processes are a family of probability distributions over
subsets of a given ground set. They are very important in integrable
probability, e.g., in the study of random matrices. In statistics and machine
learning, they have been used to model random selections over finite
dictionaries. In some cases, their most attractive feature is a property called
negative association, which, intuitively, enforces diversity within the randomly
selected items. In this talk, I will give a formal definition of these objects
and discuss somestatistical problems such as identifiability and estimation.

###### Biography

I am currently a professor of statistics at ENSAE. My research interests are
mostly centered around the interactions between data and geometry. In the past,
I have worked on stochastic geometry - I studied random polytopes and their
applications to statistics, and I am currently working on inference based on
Riemannian data. I have also worked on various other topics, including
determinantal point processes, robust and private inference, generative models,
etc.
