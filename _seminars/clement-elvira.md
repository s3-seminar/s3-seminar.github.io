###### Abstract
Spreading the information over all coefficients of a representation is
a desirable property in many applications such as digital
communication or machine learning. This so-called antisparse
representation can be obtained by solving a convex program involving a
$\ell_\infty$-norm penalty combined with a quadratic discrepancy. In
this talk, we propose a new methodology, dubbed safe squeezing, to
accelerate the computation of antisparse representation. We describe a
test that allows to detect saturated entries in the solution of the
optimization problem. The contribution of these entries is compacted
into a single vector, resulting in a form of dimensionality reduction.
We propose two algorithms to solve the latter lower dimensional
problem. Numerical experiments show both the effectiveness of the
saturation detection tests and that the proposed procedures lead to
significant computational gains as compared to existing methods.
