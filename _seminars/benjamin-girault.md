###### Abstract
During the past few years, graph signal processing has been extending
the field of signal processing on Euclidean spaces to irregular spaces
represented by graphs. We have seen successes ranging from the Fourier
transform, to wavelets, vertex-frequency (time-frequency)
decomposition, sampling theory, uncertainty principle, or convolutive
filtering. One missing ingredient though are the tools to study
stochastic graph signals for which the randomness introduces its own
difficulties. Classical signal processing has introduced a very simple
yet very rich class of stochastic signals that is at the core of the
study of stochastic signals: the stationary signals. These are the
signals statistically invariant through a shift of the origin of time.
In this talk, we study two extensions of stationarity to graph
signals, one that stems from a new translation operator for graph
signals, and another one with a more sensible interpretation on the
graph. In the course, we show that attempts of alternate definitions
of stationarity on graphs in the recent literature are actually
equivalent to our first definition. Finally, we look at a real weather
dataset and show empirical evidence of stationarity.

###### Biography
Benjamin Girault received his License (B.Sc.) and his Master (M.Sc.)
in France from École Normale Supérieure de Cachan, France, in 2009 and
2012 respectively in the field of theoretical computer science. He
then received his PhD in computer science from École Normale
Supérieure de Lyon, France, in December 2015. His dissertation
entitled "Signal Processing on Graphs - Contributions to an Emerging
Field" focused on extending the classical definition of stationary
temporal signals to stationary graph signal. Currently, he is a
postdoctoral scholar with Antonio Ortega and Shri Narayanan at the
University of Southern California continuing his work on graph signal
processing with a focus on applying these tools to understanding human
behavior.
