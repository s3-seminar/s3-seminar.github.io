###### Abstract

In this talk, we will discuss the use of deep learning in statistical signal processing.
We will address settings in which the classical solutions are intractable and will propose modern approaches based on neural networks.
We will begin with parameter estimation and focus on learning non-linear minimum variance unbiased estimators (MVUE).
Next, we will switch to detection theory and focus on learning classifiers with constant false alarm rates (CFAR).
In both settings, we provide deep learning methods that achieve these goals in practice,
as well as theory that highlights the relations to the classical likelihood based solutions.
