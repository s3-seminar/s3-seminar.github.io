###### Abstract
This paper discusses the outlier effects on the estimation of a
spectral estimator for long memory process under additive outliers and
proposes robust spectral estimators. Some asymptotic properties of the
proposed robust methods are derived and Monte Carlo simulations
investigate their empirical properties. Pollution series, such as, PM
(Particulate matter), SO2 (Sulfur dioxide), are the applied examples
investigated here to show the usefulness of the proposed robust
methods in real applications. These pollutants present, in general,
observations with high levels of pollutant concentrations which may
produce sample densities with heavy tails and these high levels of
concentrations can be identified as outliers which can destroy the
statistical properties of sample functions such as the standard mean,
covariance and the periodogram.
