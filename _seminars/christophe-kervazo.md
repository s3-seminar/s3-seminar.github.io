###### Abstract

Over the last decades, sparse Blind Source Separation (BSS) has become a
well-established tool for a wide range of applications. Classical
optimization-based sparse BSS methods, such as the Proximal Alternating
Linearized Minimization (PALM) algorithm, nevertheless often rely on a
cumbersome handcrafted hyper-parameter choice, undermining their practical
results and making them difficult to use. In this presentation, we will
therefore explore several strategies to bypass this pitfall. We will start by
exploring some statistic-based automatic hyper-parameter choice rules, and we
will eventually discuss data-driven methods leveraging algorithm
unrolling/unfolding. We will furthermore consider an extension of sparse BSS to
continuous target extraction in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Overall,
we will show that our findings can contribute to a wide range of imaging
applications: astrophysics, remote sensing and biomedical imaging, to only name
a few.

###### Biography

Christophe Kervazo received Supélec engineering degree in 2015, and the master
of science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of
Technology (USA) in 2016. From 2016 to 2019, he was a PhD student in the
CosmoStat group at CEA Saclay, where he worked on the optimization framework for
sparse blind source separation, as well as non-linear component separation. He
then went for one year in Mons (Belgium) where he worked, as a post-doctoral
researcher, on the extension of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization to
Linear-Quadratic mixture unmixing, with mathematical guarantees. He is currently
an Assistant Professor at Télécom Paris, in the IMAGES group, were he now mainly
works on deep-learning tools for inverse problems, with a focus on algorithm
unrolling/unfolding. His works main current application is remote sensing
imaging, but he also works on biomedical data.
