###### Abstract
A largely unresolved problem in hearing sciences concerns the large
heterogeneity observed among individuals with similar audiograms
(hearing thresholds measured in quiet) in understanding speech in
noisy environments. Recent studies suggest that supra-threshold
auditory mechanisms (i.e. that operate above detection threshold) play
a prominent role in these interindividual differences, but a precise
view of where and how distortions arise along the auditory processing
hierarchy is lacking. Addressing this problem requires novel
approaches that not do simply consider hearing in terms of
sensitivity, but in terms of fidelity of encoding. In this talk, I
will present a novel methodological framework developed for this
purpose, which combines signal-processing with psychoacoustical tests
and computational modeling tools derived from system identification
methods. I will present and discuss results from several experiments
conducted in both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired individuals
within this framework to characterize the processing of supra-
threshold signals made of spectrotemporal modulations -- broadband
noises whose envelope is jointly modulated over time and frequency --
which constitute the most crucial features underlying speech
intelligibility. I will then explain how the detailed computational
characterization returned from this joined experimental-modeling
approach can be used to identify the different components underlying
suprathreshold auditory encoding deficits. Overall, this project
describes an innovative approach that capitalizes on system-
engineering methods to shed an unprecedented light on supra-threshold
hearing and its disorders. By integrating the knowledge of how the
auditory system operates above the threshold in noisy conditions, this
project will generate new avenues for the development of novel
audiological procedures and signal-processing strategies for hearing
aids.

###### Biography
Emmanuel Ponsot was initially trained in Engineering at Ecole Centrale
(Lyon), and received a Master degree in Acoustics in 2012. He then
turned to Psychoacoustics and Cognitive Sciences and obtained a Ph.D.
from Sorbonne Université in 2015 on loudness processing and coding in
humans. From 2015 to 2017, he did a first postdoc at IRCAM (Paris),
during which he developed new tools to explore the computational bases
of Social Cognition in speech prosody. He is currently a post-doctoral
researcher at the Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs (ENS, Paris),
where he combines experimental and modeling approaches to characterize
the auditory mechanisms used to process complex supra-threshold
signals in noise, in both normal-hearing individuals and individuals
with hearing loss.
