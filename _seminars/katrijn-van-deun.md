###### Abstract
Research in the behavioural and social sciences has entered the era of
big data: Many detailed measurements are taken and multiple sources of
information are used to unravel complex multivariate relations. For
example, in studying obesity as the outcome of environmental and
genetic influences, researchers increasingly collect survey, dietary,
biomarker and genetic data from the same individuals. Although linked
more-variables-than-samples (called high-dimensional) multi-source
data form an extremely rich resource for research, extracting
meaningful and integrated information is challenging and not
appropriately addressed by current statistical methods. A first
problem is that relevant information is hidden in a bulk of irrelevant
variables with a high risk of finding incidental associations. Second,
the sources are often very heterogeneous, which may obscure apparent
links between the shared mechanisms. In this presentation we will
discuss the challenges associated to the analysis of large scale
multi-source data and present state-of-the-art statistical approaches
to address the challenges.
