###### Abstract
Covariance matrices play a major role in statistics, signal processing and
machine learning applications. This seminar focuses on the semiparametric
covariance/scatter matrix estimation problem in elliptical distributions. The
class of elliptical distributions can be seen as a semiparametric model where
the finite-dimensional vector of interest is given by the location vector and by
the (vectorized) covariance/scatter matrix, while the density generator
represents an infinite-dimensional nuisance function. The main aim of the
statistical inference in elliptically distributed data is then to provide
possible estimators of the finite-dimensional parameter vector able to reconcile
the two dichotomic concepts of robustness and (semiparametric) efficiency. An
R-estimator satisfying these requirements has been recently proposed by Hallin,
Oja, and Paindaveine for real-valued elliptical data by exploiting the Le Cam’s
theory of one-step efficient estimators and the rank-based statistics. In this
seminar, we firstly recall the building blocks underlying the derivation of such
real-valued R-estimator, then its extension to complex-valued data is proposed.
Moreover, through numerical simulations, its estimation performance and
robustness to outliers are investigated in a finite-sample regime.

###### Biography
Stefano FORTUNATI graduated cum laude in telecommunication engineering and
received the PhD at the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2008 and 2012
respectively. In 2012, he joined the Department of “Ingegneria
dell’Informazione” of the University of Pisa, where he worked as researcher with
a Post-Doc position until Sept. 2019. Since Oct. 2019, he is with the
Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes (L2S) CentraleSupélec, Gif-sur-Yvette,
France. From Sept. 2020 he is a permanent lecturer (enseignant-chercheur) at
IPSA in the Parisian campus of Ivry-sur-Seine. From Sept. 2012 to Nov. 2012 and
from Sept. 2013 to Nov. 2013, he was a visiting researcher at the CMRE NATO
Research Center in La Spezia, Italy. From May 2017 to April 2018, he spent a
period of one year as visiting researcher with the Signal Processing Group, at
the Technische Universität Darmstadt. He was a recipient of the 2019 EURASIP
JASP Best Paper Award. Dr. Fortunati’s professional expertise encompasses
different areas of the statistical signal processing, with particular focus on
point estimation and hypothesis testing, performance bounds, misspecification
theory, robust and semiparametric statistics and statistical learning theory.
