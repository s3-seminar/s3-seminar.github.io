###### Abstract
In this talk, we study quantum filtering and its stability problem.
Indeed, we show that the fidelity between the state of a continuously
observed quantum system and the state of its associated quantum
filter, is always a sub-martingale. The observed system could be
governed by a continuous-time Stochastic Master Equation (SME), driven
simultaneously by Wiener and Poisson processes which takes into
account incompleteness and errors in measurements. This stability
result is the continuous-time counterpart of a similar stability
result already established for discrete-time quantum systems. This
result implies the stability of such filtering process but does not
necessarily ensure the asymptotic convergence of such quantum filters.

###### Biography
Nina H. Amini is a CNRS researcher at Laboratory L2S at
CentraleSupelec since October 2014. She did her first postdoc from
June 2012 for six months at ANU, College of Engineering and Computer
Science and her second postdoc at Edward L. Ginzton Laboratory,
Stanford University since December 2012. She received her Ph.D. in
Mathematics and Control Engineering from Mines-ParisTech (Ecole des
Mines de Paris), in September 2012. Prior to her Ph.D., she earned a
Master in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at ENSAE and the
Engineering Diploma of l’Ecole Polytechnique, in 2009. Her research
interests include stochastic control, quantum control, (quantum)
filtering theory, (quantum) probability, and (quantum) information
theory.
