###### Abstract
Composite laminates are commonly utilized in industry due to
advantages as high stiffness, light weight, versatility, etc. Multiple
layers, each one involving periodically-positioned circular-
cylindrical fibers in a given homogeneous matrix, are usually
involved. However, defects can affect the structure and thereupon
impact security and efficiency, and they call for nondestructive
testing. By electromagnetic (EM) means, it requires fast and reliable
computational modeling of both sound and damaged laminates if one
wishes to better understand pluses and minuses of the testing, and
derive efficient imaging algorithms for the end user. Both direct
modeling and inverse imaging will be introduced in this presentation.
For the former, since the periodicity of the structure is destroyed
due to defects, methods based on the Floquet theorem are inapplicable.
Two modeling approaches are then utilized: one is with supercell
methodology where a fictitious periodic structure is fabricated, so as
the EM field solution everywhere in space can be well approximately
modeled, provided the supercell be large enough; the other is based on
fictitious source superposition (FSS) where defects are treated as
equivalent sources and the field solution is a summation of responses
to the exterior source and equivalent ones. For imaging, with MUSIC
and sparsity-based algorithm, missing fibers could be accurately
located.

Zicheng LIU was born in Puyang, China, in October 1988. He received
the M.S. degree in circuit and system from Xidian University, Xi’an,
China in March 2014 and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with
the benefit of a Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) grant at the
Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes, jointly Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), CentraleSupélec, and Université Paris-
Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Paris, France. He will defend his
Université Paris-Saclay Ph.D. early Fall 2017. His present work is on
the electromagnetic modeling of damaged periodic fiber-based laminates
and corresponding imaging algorithms and inversion. His research
interests include computational electromagnetics, scattering theory on
periodic structures, non-destructive testing, sparsity theory, and
array signal processing.
