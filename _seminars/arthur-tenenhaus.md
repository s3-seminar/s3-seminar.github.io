###### Abstract
In contrast to standard data that is structured by a single
individuals variables data matrix, structured data are characterized
by multiple and heterogeneous sources of information, interconnected,
potentially of high dimensions. In addition, each source of
information may also have a complex structure (e.g. tensor structure).
The need to analyze the data by taking into account their natural
structure appears to be essential but requires the development of new
statistical techniques that constitute the core of my current research
for many years. More specifically, I will present a unified framework
for multiblock, multigroup and multiway data analysis through
Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis.
