###### Abstract
Studies on speech production are based on the extraction and the
analysis of the acoustic features of human speech, and also on their
relationships with the articulatory and phonatory configurations
realized by the speaker. An interesting tool, which will be the topic
of the talk, to make such researches is the articulatory synthesis,
which consists in the numerical simulation of the mechanical and
acoustical phenomena that are involved in speech production. The aim
is to numerically reproduce a speech signal that contains the observed
acoustic features with regards to the actual articulatory and
phonatory gestures of the speaker. Using the articulatory approach may
lead to a few problems that will be tackled in this talk, and to which
possible solutions will be discussed. Firstly, the different
articulatory gestures realized in natural speech should be precisely
observed. For that purpose, the first part of the talk focuses on
methods to acquire articulatory films of the vocal tract by MRI
techniques with a fast acquisition rate via sparse techniques
(Compressed Sensing). The aim is, in fine, to build an articulatory
and a coarticulation model. The investigation of the acoustical
phenomena involved in natural speech require to separate the
contributions of the different acoustic sources in the speech signal.
The periodic/aperiodic decomposition of the speech signal is the
subject of the second part of the talk. The challenge is to be able to
study the acoustic properties of the frication noise that is generated
during the production of fricatives, and also to quantify the amount
of voicing produced during fricatives. Finally, in order to directly
use the analysis by synthesis methods, it is interesting to estimate
the articulatory configurations of the speaker from the acoustic
signal. This is the aim of the acoustic-articulatory inversion for
copy synthesis, which is the third part of the talk. Direct
applications of these problems for the study of speech production and
phonetics will be presented.
