###### Abstract
Numerous experimental studies investigate how neural representations
of a signal depend on its past context. Although synaptic plasticity
and adaptation may play a crucial role to shape this dependence, we
study here the hypothesis that this dependence upon past context may
be also explained by dynamical network effects, in particular due to
the recurrent nature of neural networks connectivity.
