###### Abstract

In this presentation, Riemannian geometry for data analysis is introduced. In
particular, it is applied on two specific statistical signal processing
problems: blind source separation and low-rank structured covariance matrices.
Blind source separation can be solved by jointly diagonalizing some covariance
matrices. We show here how geometry can be exploited in order to provide
original joint diagonalization criteria and ways to compare them theoretically.
These results are illustrated with numerical experiments both on simulated and
real data. Concerning low-rank structured covariance matrices, an intrinsic
Cramér-Rao bound of the corresponding estimation problem is presented,
illustrating the interest of geometry for performance analysis. These results
are validated with simulations.
