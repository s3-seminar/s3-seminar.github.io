###### Abstract

We study sparse spikes deconvolution over the space of complex-
valued measures when the input measure is a finite sum of Dirac masses. We
introduce a new procedure to handle the spike deconvolution when the noise level
is unknown. Prediction and localization results will be
presented for this approach. An insight on the probabilistic tools used in the
proofs could be briefly given as well.
