###### Abstract
In perfusion MRI (p-MRI) exams, short-axis (SA) image sequences are
captured at multiple slice levels along the long-axis of the heart
during the transit of a vascular contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) through the
cardiac chambers and muscle. Compensating cardio-thoracic motions is a
requirement for enabling computer-aided quantitative assessment of
myocardial ischaemia from contrast-enhanced p-MRI sequences. The
classical paradigm consists of registering each sequence frame on a
reference image using some intensity-based matching criterion. In this
work, we present an unsupervised method for the spatio-temporal
groupwise registration of cardiac p-MRI exams based on mutual
information (MI) between high-dimensional feature distributions. Here,
local contrast enhancement curves are used as a dense set of spatio-
temporal features, and statistically matched through variational
optimization to a target feature distribution derived from a
registered reference template. The hard issue of probability density
estimation in high-dimensional state spaces is bypassed by using
consistent geometric entropy estimators, allowing MI to be computed
directly from feature samples.

###### Biography
Sameh Hamrouni received her MSc in computer vision from National
computer science engineering school (Tunis) in 2008. She joined
Institut Telecom SudParis in 2009 for a PhD in image processing where
she studied spatio-temporal variational approach for quantitative
analysis of myocardial perfusion in MRI, supervised by Nicolas Rougon
and Françoise Prêteux. She joined Université Paris Descartes/LIPADE
team in 2013 working on image processing projects. Since 2015, Sameh
joined GE healthcare as an image quality engineer (Buc, France). Her
research interests include image processing and medical physics.
