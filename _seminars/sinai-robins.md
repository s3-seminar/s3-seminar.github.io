###### Abstract
Abstract: We introduce the topic of the Fourier transform of a
Euclidean polytope, first by examples and then by more general
formulations. Then we point out how we can use this transform (and the
frequency space) to analyze the following problems: 1. Compute lattice
point enumeration formulas for polytopes 2. Relate the transforms of
polytopes to tilings of Euclidean space by translations of a polytope
We will give a flavor of how such applications arise, and we point to
some conjectures and applications.
