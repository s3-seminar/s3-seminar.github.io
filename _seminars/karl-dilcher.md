###### Abstract
We prove an explicit formula for the polynomial part of a restricted
partition function, also known as the first Sylvester wave. This is
achieved by way of some identities for higher-order Bernoulli
polynomials, one of which is analogous to Raabe's well-known
multiplication formula for the ordinary Bernoulli polynomials. As a
consequence of our main result we obtain an asymptotic expression of
the first Sylvester wave as the coefficients of the restricted
partition grow arbitrarily large. (Joint work with Christophe Vignat).
