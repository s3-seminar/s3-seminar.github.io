###### Abstract
Mixed Integer Programs (MIP) represent a powerful tool to model Combinatorial
Optimization problems, although the resolution of a MIP is in general an NP-hard
problem. Nevertheless, much progress has been made in the last decades to
improve the performance of the practical resolution of MIP models, and nowadays,
commercial solvers can solve models with thousands of integer variables, in
considerable small times.

In this talk we will give an introduction to the basic ideas behind these
algorithms, namely, linear programs solving, branch and bound algorithms and
cutting planes techniques. We will then illustrate some of these techniques with
a MIP formulation for Sparse Approximation problems.

###### Biography
I got my Computer Scientist degree at the University of Buenos Aires (Faculty of
Natural and Exact Sciences), Argentina in 2009 and a PhD in Computer Sciences at
the same university in 2016. My main research interests cover topics around
combinatorial optimization, applied mathematics, linear integer programming and
graph theory. I am also very interested in applied real-life projects concerning
these topics.

At present, I have a full-time postdoctoral fellowship position split within the
Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'École Polytechnique de Paris (LIX) and the
Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes (L2S) Centralesupelec, where I'm working on
a project which aims to apply several optimization techniques to the resolution
of sparse systems in the context of parsimony sampling (or compressive sensing).
