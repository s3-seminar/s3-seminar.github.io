#excerpt: "Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get the ball #rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it."

The goal is to welcome recognized researchers, PhD students and post-docs on the
field of signal processing, data science and its applications. It is open to
everyone and is usually hosted every Friday morning 10:30 am, « Salle des
séminaire » C4.01 (C4 stairs, 4th floor), CentraleSupélec, Breguet Building.
Coffee and croissants before each seminar.
